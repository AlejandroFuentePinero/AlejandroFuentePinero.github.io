Abstract - Long-term research on the impact of climate change on tropical montane biodiversity in the Australian Wet Tropics holds profound implications for our understanding of the escalating crisis. Results from more than thirty years of monitoring effort in the rainforest of north-east Queensland demonstrate that climate change is driving biodiversity erosion at an alarming rate, particularly affecting species with narrow environmental ranges. Rising temperatures and increasing frequency of extreme heatwaves pose severe threats to the population dynamics of various species, leading to rapid declines and even local extinctions. Furthermore, the observed changes in distribution and abundance of species underscore the urgency to address the vulnerability of montane ecosystems worldwide. This research highlights the critical importance of unravelling the drivers of climate change impacts on population changes, offering significant insight into the mechanisms accelerating climate-induced biodiversity degradation. The findings serve as a wake-up call for immediate action to preserve these fragile ecosystems and the irreplaceable biodiversity they support. As we face the consequences of a changing climate, this research provides a compelling foundation for the development of effective conservation strategies and policies to safeguard tropical montane biodiversity for generations to come.
