[Introduction to hierarchical models for abundance](https://github.com/AlejandroFuentePinero/Nmixture_Frogs_CodeR) - This talk aims to introduce one of the most powerful models to estimate population size from survey data, an essential skill in any ecologist's toolkit. I will show how it is possible to estimate abundance while accounting for imperfect detection, and we will discuss the implications of this. This model is particularly useful to infer population size from counts of unmarked individuals, although its flexibility allows complex modifications to fit a huge variety of ecological data.
