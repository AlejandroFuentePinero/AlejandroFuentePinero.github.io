Welcome! 
My research focuses on undestanding the impacts of climate change on tropical biodiversity. I study climate change from the lense of population dynamics. My studies take place in tropical mountains, which are consider natural laboratories for the study of climate change. This is because in tropical mountains, elevation defines a strong gradient across which most ecological processes vary. Since elevation defines a natural thermal gradient across the distribution of montane species, these ecosystems are the ideal scenario to study rapid climate-driven population changes in sensitive species.
My current research focuses on the rainforest ringtail possum community endemic to the Australian Wet Tropics.
