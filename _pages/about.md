Welcome to my website!

My research focuses on undestanding the impacts of climate change on tropical biodiversity. I study climate change from the lense of population dynamics. My studies take place in tropical mountains, which are consider natural laboratories for the study of climate change. This is because in tropical mountains, elevation defines a strong gradient across which most ecological processes vary. Since elevation defines a natural thermal gradient across the distribution of montane species, these ecosystems are the ideal scenario to study rapid climate-driven population changes in sensitive species.
My current research focuses on the rainforest ringtail possum community endemic to the Australian Wet Tropics.

# Current projects

### Age-structure population model for rainforest ringtail possums.
* Brief summary: I am developping a structure population model based on the life cycle of rainforest ringtail possums to determine the factor shaping the spatial variation in population dynamics.
* Aim: Determine the influence of environmental and geological gradients on the survival and recruitment of ringtail possums.
* Expected results: The population dynamics of ringtail possums is strongly controlled by the interaction between soil fertility and temperature. Temperature imposes a physiological control on the survival of the species. Soil fertility affect the recruitment in the population through temperature. That is, recruitment is significantly higher in areas of high soil fertility, but only if the temperature is low enough to enable the persistance of the species.
