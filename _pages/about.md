Welcome to my website!

My research focuses on undestanding the impacts of climate change on tropical biodiversity. I study climate change from the lense of population dynamics. My studies take place in tropical mountains, which are consider natural laboratories for the study of climate change. This is because in tropical mountains, elevation defines a strong gradient across which most ecological processes vary. Since elevation defines a natural thermal gradient across the distribution of montane species, these ecosystems are the ideal scenario to study rapid climate-driven population changes in sensitive species.
My current research focuses on the rainforest ringtail possum community endemic to the Australian Wet Tropics.

# Current projects

### Age-structure population model for rainforest ringtail possums.
* We aim to understand the spatial variation in the population structure of rainforest ringtail possums, as well as the proccess that govern this variability. In this project, we are constructing age-structure population model using 3 years of abundance (juveniles and adults) data across 32 sites in the Australian Wet Tropics. We established the study sites across the thermal (elevation) and geological (soil fertility) gradients to understand the interaction between the species [thermal intolerance](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-011-2146-2) and site fertility. We are expecting to find a strong interaction between these variables, with fertile soil not only enabling a larger population size, but also a higher tolerance to heatwaves.
