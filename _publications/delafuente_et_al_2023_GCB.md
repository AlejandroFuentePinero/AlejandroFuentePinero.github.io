# Abstract

Climate-driven  biodiversity  erosion  is  escalating  at  an  alarming  rate.  The  pressure  imposed  by  climate  change  is  exceptionally  high  in  tropical  ecosystems,  where  spe-cies adapted to narrow environmental ranges exhibit strong physiological constraints. Despite the observed detrimental effect of climate change on ecosystems at a global scale, our understanding of the extent to which multiple climatic drivers affect popu-lation dynamics is limited. Here, we disentangle the impact of different climatic stress-ors on 47 rainforest birds inhabiting the mountains of the Australian Wet Tropics using hierarchical population models. We estimate the effect of spatiotemporal changes in temperature, precipitation, heatwaves, droughts and cyclones on the population dy-namics of rainforest birds between 2000 and 2016. We find a strong effect of warming and changes in rainfall patterns across the elevational-segregated bird communities, with  lowland  populations  benefiting  from  increasing  temperature  and  precipitation,  while upland species show an inverse strong negative response to the same drivers. Additionally, we find a negative effect of heatwaves on lowland populations, a pattern associated with the observed distribution of these extreme events across elevations. In contrast, cyclones and droughts have a marginal effect on spatiotemporal changes in  rainforest  bird  communities,  suggesting  a  species-specific  response  unrelated  to  the elevational gradient. This study demonstrated the importance of unravelling the drivers of climate change impacts on population changes, providing significant insight into the mechanisms accelerating climate-induced biodiversity degradation.
